# ocaml-microservices
A list of ready-to-use microservices written in OCaml.

**I didn't give up the idea of building a list of microservices written in OCaml or in other programming languages like Scala or Python. The problem with OCaml is to choose the right workflows and the right libraries to build strong micro services. It is what I'm working on for the moment and it's why no micro services have been written for the moment. Do not hesitate to contact me at contact@danny-willems.be for any request.**
